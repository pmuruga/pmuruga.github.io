I am an M.Eng. student at MIT in the lab of [Arup Chakraborty](http://chakrabortygroup.scripts.mit.edu/). 
My research focuses on developing biophysical models of the adaptive immune system and viral dynamics. I am also investigating the use of quantum machine learning to solve problems in biology.

Previously, I received my S.B. from MIT with a double major in Physics and in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Over the course of my undergraduate degree, I worked as a machine learning research intern at [Genesis Therapeutics](https://www.genesistherapeutics.ai/), 
and in the labs of [Mark Harnett](https://www.markharnett.org/) (MIT) and [Wesley Tansey](https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/labs/wesley-tansey) (MSKCC).

In my free time, I dance competitively with teams at MIT and enjoy working out and cooking.

Feel free to take a look around! I have a selected list of publications and projects in a wide range of topics highlighted in the respective sections. Currently, I'm best contacted at pmurugan [at] mit [dot] edu.
