I am a Machine Learning Research Engineer at [Genesis Therapeutics](https://www.genesistherapeutics.ai/), working on cutting-edge generative and predictive machine learning methods for small-molecule drug discovery. My particular interests lie in teaching machine learning models the symmetries and inductive biases present in physics at the atomic scale.

Previously, I received my M.Eng. and S.B. from MIT with a double major in Physics and in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I primarily worked in the lab of [Arup Chakraborty](http://chakrabortygroup.scripts.mit.edu/), where I studied computational models of the human immune system and leveraged tools from statistical mechanics, information theory, and even bespoke CUDA-accelerated stochastic simulation. Over the course of my undergraduate degree, I also worked as a machine learning research intern at [Genesis Therapeutics](https://www.genesistherapeutics.ai/), 
and in the labs of [Mark Harnett](https://www.markharnett.org/) (MIT) and [Wesley Tansey](https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/labs/wesley-tansey) (MSKCC).

In my free time, I dance and climb mountains with my friends.

Feel free to take a look around! I have a selected list of publications and projects in a wide range of topics highlighted in the respective sections. Currently, I'm best contacted at pranav [at] genesistherapeutics [dot] ai.
